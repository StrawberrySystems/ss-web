		  <p>Unlike mega-players in the IT consulting industry, our team will base solution recommendations on what you need, not the technology we’re trying to sell.  Collaboration is a keystone of our delivery approach.  We align with clients, turning engagements into long-term partnerships.</p>

		  <p>Strawberry Systems applies proprietary methodologies and accelerators to increase the speed of projects and improve return on investment.  These approaches can also reduce risk and increase functionality according to each client’s needs.</p>

		  <p>And, Strawberry Systems provides better communication than pure-play offshore providers because we speak your local language.  As a client, you have unmatched access to our consultants.  It’s open, secure, mobile and will adapt to your specific business needs.</p>
