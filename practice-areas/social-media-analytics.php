	    <p class="lead">Strawberry Systems can help your enterprise integrate social media analytics with an effective roadmap to achieve success.  We enable you to build a business case toward integrating social media, determining the channels to leverage, then identifying and integrating the most effective business value drivers.  Recent advances in technology such as Hadoop, NoSQL, and Data Virtualization have created a strong technology platform to tackle these vast amounts of disparate data. The issue is more of complexities and vagaries of data as opposed to the technology to assimilate and analyze it.  Strawberry Systems provides the clarity on how to work with this aggregate search data to build a viable solution, and then leverage that solution to your advantage.</p>
